# T1K Context Block

Every teammate spawn prompt MUST include this context block at the end. Replace `{placeholders}` with actual values.

## Template

```
T1K Context:
- Work dir: {CWD}
- Reports: {CWD}/plans/reports/
- Plans: {CWD}/plans/
- Branch: {current git branch}
- Kit: {from metadata.json → name} v{version}
- Installed modules: {comma-separated from metadata.json → installedModules}
- Your module scope: {module name if scoped, "all" if kit-wide}
- Your module skills: {comma-separated from module's activation fragment}
- Registry role: {role resolved from t1k-routing-*.json, e.g., "implementer → unity-developer"}
- File ownership: {glob patterns from manifest, e.g., "Assets/Combat/**, Scripts/Combat/**"}
- Commits: conventional (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, chore:)
- Refer to teammates by NAME, not agent ID
- Follow rules in .claude/rules/ (loaded automatically)
- Mark tasks completed via TaskUpdate BEFORE sending completion message
```

## How to Build

1. Read `.claude/metadata.json` → extract kit name, version, installedModules
2. Resolve agent role via `skills/t1k-cook/references/routing-protocol.md`
3. Read module's `.t1k-manifest.json` → extract file list → derive ownership globs
4. Read module's activation fragment → extract skill names
5. Get current git branch: `git branch --show-current`
6. Substitute all placeholders

## Example (Unity Kit, Combat Module)

```
T1K Context:
- Work dir: /home/user/my-game
- Reports: /home/user/my-game/plans/reports/
- Plans: /home/user/my-game/plans/
- Branch: feat/combat-overhaul
- Kit: theonekit-unity v2.3.0
- Installed modules: dots-core, dots-combat, ui, balance
- Your module scope: dots-combat
- Your module skills: t1k-combat-patterns, t1k-ecs-helpers
- Registry role: implementer → dots-combat-implementer
- File ownership: Assets/Scripts/Combat/**, Assets/Tests/Combat/**
- Commits: conventional (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, chore:)
- Refer to teammates by NAME, not agent ID
- Follow rules in .claude/rules/ (loaded automatically)
- Mark tasks completed via TaskUpdate BEFORE sending completion message
```
